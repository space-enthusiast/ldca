When building a chat application using Kafka, the structure of topics, consumer groups, and consumers should be designed to handle the communication between multiple users across multiple chatrooms efficiently. Here’s a way to structure them:

1. Topics:
   One Topic per Chatroom:
   Topic Naming Convention: Use a distinct topic for each chatroom. For example, chatroom_<chatroom_id> where <chatroom_id> is a unique identifier for each chatroom.
   Purpose: This allows messages within a chatroom to be isolated, ensuring that only participants in the chatroom receive the messages.
   Message Format: Messages published to a topic could include metadata like sender ID, timestamp, message content, etc.
2. Consumers:
   One Consumer per User in a Chatroom:
   User-specific Consumers: Each user participating in a chatroom would have their own consumer subscribed to the respective chatroom's topic.
   Message Handling: This consumer will consume messages from the chatroom topic and display them to the user in real time.
3. Consumer Groups:
   User-based Consumer Groups:
   Consumer Group Naming Convention: Each user could have their own consumer group, or if users need to process messages in parallel, you can have multiple consumers under a single consumer group for load balancing.
   One-to-One Mapping: Typically, in a chat application, you might want each user to receive all messages in the chatroom, so each user would have their own consumer group. This ensures that every user gets all messages independently of each other.
   Handling Read Receipts: If you want to track whether a message has been consumed by all users in a chatroom, you might use a consumer group per chatroom instead, where each consumer corresponds to a user. This way, the message is considered consumed only when all users have read it.
   Example Structure:
   User Joins a Chatroom:

A user joins chatroom 12345.
A Kafka consumer is created for the user with a consumer group named user_<user_id>.
The consumer subscribes to the topic chatroom_12345.
Sending a Message:

The user sends a message, which is published to the topic chatroom_12345.
All consumers subscribed to chatroom_12345 (i.e., all users in the chatroom) will receive this message.
Receiving Messages:

Each user's consumer will consume the messages from chatroom_12345 and display them in the user’s chat interface.
Since each user has their own consumer group, they all receive all messages.
Additional Considerations:
Partitioning: If a chatroom has a very large number of participants or high message volume, consider partitioning the chatroom topic to improve scalability. However, ensure that message order is maintained within each partition.
Offsets Management: Kafka automatically manages offsets, but you might want to persist offsets externally if you need custom behavior like marking messages as read or implementing "last read" features.
Durability: Configure Kafka with appropriate replication and retention policies to ensure messages are not lost and can be consumed even if users come online later.
Example Workflow:
User A sends a message in chatroom 12345:

Message is published to chatroom_12345 topic.
All users in chatroom 12345 (say User B and User C) have consumers subscribed to chatroom_12345 and receive the message.
User B joins chatroom 67890:

A new consumer is created for User B in a new consumer group user_<user_b_id>.
The consumer subscribes to the chatroom_67890 topic.
User B now receives messages from chatroom_67890.
This structure ensures that messages are delivered to the appropriate users in each chatroom and allows the system to scale with the number of users and chatrooms.

can i get One-to-One Mapping and Handling Read Receipts?

Certainly! Let's break down how you can achieve both One-to-One Mapping and Handling Read Receipts in a Kafka-based chat application:

1. One-to-One Mapping (Consumer Groups and Users):
   In the One-to-One Mapping scenario, each user in a chatroom has their own consumer group. This ensures that every user receives all messages independently, regardless of other users in the chatroom.

How it Works:
Consumer Group per User:
For each user in a chatroom, a separate consumer group is created.
The consumer in this group subscribes to the chatroom’s topic.
Example:
Chatroom 12345 has three users: Alice, Bob, and Charlie.
Alice is assigned to the consumer group user_alice.
Bob is assigned to the consumer group user_bob.
Charlie is assigned to the consumer group user_charlie.
All three consumers subscribe to the topic chatroom_12345.
Implication:
Each user receives all messages independently, and message delivery to one user does not affect the delivery to others.

2. Handling Read Receipts:
   To implement Read Receipts—where you track which users in a chatroom have seen (or read) a message—you need to consider how Kafka handles message consumption and how you can capture the "read" status.

How it Works:
Consumer Group per Chatroom (Alternative Approach):

Instead of having a separate consumer group for each user, you might use a single consumer group per chatroom. Each user is a consumer in this group.
This way, you can track when all users in the chatroom have consumed a particular message.
Offset Tracking for Read Receipts:

Kafka tracks the offset (the position in the log) for each consumer group. By examining the offsets, you can determine if all users in the chatroom have consumed (i.e., read) a message.
You can store the read status in an external database or use Kafka’s own offset tracking to monitor when each user has consumed each message.
Example:
Chatroom 12345 has three users: Alice, Bob, and Charlie.
You create a single consumer group chatroom_12345_group for the chatroom.
Alice, Bob, and Charlie are consumers in this group.
When a message is sent to chatroom_12345, it is consumed by each of these users.
Tracking Read Receipts:

After sending a message, you can track the offsets for each user in the chatroom to determine if they have read the message.
If Alice and Bob have consumed a message but Charlie has not, the message will be marked as "unread" for Charlie.
Steps to Implement Read Receipts:
Message Metadata:

Include a unique message ID and a timestamp when publishing a message.
Store this metadata in a database along with the chatroom ID.
Track Consumption:

As each consumer (user) in the chatroom consumes the message, update the database with the read status for that user.
You can store this as a mapping between the user, chatroom ID, and message ID.
Checking Read Status:

Periodically (or when a user queries), check the database to see which users have consumed each message.
If all users in the chatroom have consumed the message, mark it as "read" for the entire chatroom.
Notification:

Notify users when their message has been read by all participants in the chatroom, based on the tracking data.
Combining Both Approaches:
Consumer Groups per User: Ensure every user gets all messages independently (One-to-One Mapping).
Tracking Read Status: Use an external system (like a database) to keep track of when each user has consumed each message, enabling read receipts.
By combining these approaches, you can have a chat application where users receive all messages independently and you can track and display read receipts for messages within each chatroom.
